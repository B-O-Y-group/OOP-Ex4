# OOP-Ex4 - BOY 

This project represents a game where a group of Agents have to catch as many Pokemons (of varying value) on a directed weighted 
graph and in order to achieve the best result  the Agents will try to catch
As many Pokemons as possible with maximum value.
Data structures and algorithms of this assignment are based on a previous project [OOP-Ex3](https://github.com/B-O-Y-group/OOP-Ex3.git). 



# **Our Algorithm**
The idea of the algorithm is to find for each agent the closest Pokemon, and so we will be caught
as many Pokemons as possible.

You can find the full information about the function here [wiki]().
